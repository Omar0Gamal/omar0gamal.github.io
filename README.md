Hi there 👋

I'm Omar, a software engineer and a freelancer. I have experience in creating websites and chatbots and Minecraft plugins using various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Next.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. I love to learn new things and develop innovative solutions. I'm currently working on a project called [**Omar0Gamal**](https://github.com/Omar0Gamal/omar0gamal.github.io), which is a personal website that showcases my skills, projects, and achievements. 🚀

My website is built with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. It features a dynamic portfolio section, a blog with markdown support, a contact form with email notifications, and a dark mode toggle. 🌙 I also use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process and GitHub Pages to host the website. 🌐

You can check out my website [here](https://omar0gamal.github.io/) and the source code [here](https://github.com/Omar0Gamal/omar0gamal.github.io). I hope you like it and find it useful. 🙌 Feel free to fork it, star it, or open an issue if you have any feedback or suggestions. 💬

In addition to coding, I have a passion for exploring new topics and enhancing my understanding. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Halwen University. 🎓 I welcome any new challenges and opportunities that can help me grow as a developer and a person. 😊

One of the topics that I'm very interested in is Computer Graphics Programming. I love to create realistic and immersive graphics using various tools and frameworks. I also have a fascination for Artificial Intelligence and its applications in different domains. I enjoy making Minecraft plugins as a hobby and as a way to practice my Java skills.

You can connect with me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-gamal-091044168/). I'm always open to networking and collaborating with other developers. 👋

Thank you for visiting my profile and happy coding! 😊
